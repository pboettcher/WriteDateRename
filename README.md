# WriteDateRename

This application is designed to rename all the files in current directory according to their write dates.

The app is intended to reside in one of PATH directories to be called from cmd console.

Running scenario is as follows:

1. run cmd and change to the desired directory.
2. Execute WriteDateRename. The app runs and warns about the current working path.
3. As a protection measure you have to type the word "continue" in because the app does mass-rename and results of such a renaming aren't reversible.
4. After that you have to answer another question whether to keep original file names as a part of new file names.
5. Once you made your choice the job will be performed quickly.
