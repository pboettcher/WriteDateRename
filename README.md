# WriteDateRename

This application is designed to rename all the files in current directory according to their write dates exact to the milliseconds.

The app is intended to reside in one of PATH directories to be called from cmd console.

Running scenario is as follows:

1. run cmd and change to the desired directory.
2. Execute WriteDateRename. The app runs and warns about the current working path.
3. As a protection measure you have to type the word "continue" in because the app does mass-rename and results of such a renaming aren't reversible.
4. Once you typed the protection word in the job is done quickly.
